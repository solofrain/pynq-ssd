Program: asic_dac_cal

Performs automatic scanning of window thresholds to measure the on-chip 6-bit
DAC slopes. The program assumes the presence of a single spectral peak in the
incident x-ray beam, or at least an Alpha-Beta doublet from a pure K-edge
fluorescence. It generates a file 'factors.dat', in the current directory. This
file will contain a measured slope for each DAC, since there is significant
dispersion in them. It works by setting all DACs to 5 values across their range,
and scanning the thresholds through the photopeak. The resulting erf()-shaped
curves are fit, and the set of fitted centroids fit again to a straight line.
The slope of this line is stored in the factors.dat file. The program is a Glade application, intended to be launched
from the 'detector' MEDM screen.
