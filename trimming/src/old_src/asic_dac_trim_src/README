Program: asic_dac_trim

Performs automatic scanning of window thresholds to measure the on-chip
comparator offsets and correct them using the on-chip 6-bit DACs. THe program
assumes the presence of a single spectral peak in the incident x-ray beam, or at
least an Alpha-Beta doublet from a pure K-edge fluorescence. It also expects a
file 'factors.dat', to be present in the current directory. THis file should
contain a previously-calibrated slope for each DAC, since there is significant
dispersion in them. If this file is missing, a fixed constant value is assumed,
taken as the average of a previous calibration set. The resulting corrections
are much better than nothing, but not as good as they could be if the file
existed. The program is a Glade application, intended to be launched from the
'detector' MEDM screen.
