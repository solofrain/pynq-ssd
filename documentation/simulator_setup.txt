    ./regpeekpoke W 104 [26] 3   // puts the fifo into test mode (will send a counter value)


    ./regpeekpoke W 40 [10] 1    //puts into simulation mode
   

    The default event rate is 1Hz.

     To change the simulated event rate
     > ./regpeekpoke W 44 [11] value    // where event rate = 50M / val   (eg  val = 50M => 
1Hz)


Attached is the new firmware with the added frame logic (version 82).   I've added the register addresses below.   One of the front panel LED's illuminates when frame is active.

To test:
> ./regpeekpoke W 212 [53] 25000000   -- sets frame length to 1 sec
> ./regpeekpoke W 208 [52] 1  - soft triggers a frame to start   (led comes on, events available)

> ./regpeekpoke R 208 [52] -- reads 1 if frame is active, 0 is frame is complete
> ./regpeekpoke R 216 [54]   -- reads current frame number (increments after frame is complete)


To tell it just to run forever without frames
>  ./regpeekpoke W 220 [55] 1
